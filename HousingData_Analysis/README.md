<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This assignment performed a single and multiple regression models to predict housing sales price in Washington State using R programming. I looked at multiple features that influence the house price and analyzed the Coefficient of Determination, Confidence interval, Anova Test result and validated multicollinearity. 


### Built With
* R Programming
* readxl
* plyr
* ggplot2
* lm.beta
* dplyr
* car

### Analysis Result
 Overall, the regression model shows unbiased because of the following:
 • Confidence Interval shows no values cross over zero thus indicates that this is not a bad model.
 • None of them have cook distance > 1 which mean none of the cases having undue influence on the  model
 • There are 454 cases that outside the leverage boundaries
 • There are 766 cases that deviate from the covariance boundaries
 • Noindication of multicollinearity since the VIF values are below 10 and tolerance statistics are above  0.2 and and Average VIF is not substantially greater than 1.
 • Histogram shows normal distribution which mean that our model is accurate for the sample and  generalized to the population
