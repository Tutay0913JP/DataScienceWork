<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

For many years, energy distribution has been one directional and electric suppliers have produced power in a scheduled and centralized system thus electric grid have easily achieved stability of supply based on the demand most of the time. With the production of power from solar energy and the increase of prosumers, the instability of energy supply and demand can cause issues in the grids because the production of renewable energy can be high at some times but can also fluctuate and not be sufficient to match the demand. This challenges grid operators and regulators to balance the demand and supply and ensure fair pricing and access for all. If this issue is not addressed, this can affect consumers in general because operators can increase the transmission charges because of the high operational cost of maintaining the infrastructure and balancing the supply and demand. This also threatens the utility business model because of a potential revenue and market share reduction. 

This project aims to build a machine learning model that will predict electric consumption with high accuracy and efficiency will provide insights for individuals on their energy bills and also for electric companies to make informed decisions based on this analysis. By forecasting the demand, electric companies will be able to reduce the waste of energy supply and efficiently plan for demand and supply, enabling effective planning and energy.

### Built With

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
### Project Scope
 Measure the relationship of multiple variables that can impact the homeless population and identify if  available public support (total number of available beds) can somehow show effectiveness when decreasing 
homelessness.


### Methods:
 1. Defining the topic of the research in which I have identified homelessness and defining variables that  impacts homelessness in the United States.
 2. Start data gathering by identifying the type of data to collect and sources of information.
 3. Data Preparation and Cleansing. I have collected public information in CVS and excel format. I have  analyzed and understand the raw data and implemented R functions to:
    * Extract relevant information
    * Reorganize the data in accordance with my intended final dataset structure format
    * Merge multiple data frame by a common data elements: state and year
    * Create new variables such as the Ratio of Homelessness to State population and the Mean value of  housing rentals.
 5. Run r code to plot the variable and see relationship with the variables in a graph.
 6. Run r code and perform correlation analysis
